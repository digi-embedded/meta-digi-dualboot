# U-Boot bootscript for altbootcmd (dual boot fallback after retries)
#

# After an upgrade, active_system has changed. U-Boot tries to boot this system
# for a number of tries. If the limit is reached, altbootcmd is run instead.
# This is the script that it will run. It has to:
#  * switch back to previous system
#  * reset the firmware update flag
#  * run the regular boot command
